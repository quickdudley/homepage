At the time I wrote a command line program in Haskell to allocate each family member another one to give a present to. This page is essentially the same thing: but in the form of a web app in React.js</p><h3>Usage</h3><p>Type the name of each participant into the text box labelled &quot;Name&quot;. If any participant requires assistance (i.e. due to visual impairment): check the box labelled &quot;Assistance required&quot; and check the names of each person able to assist. When you've finished editing a participant's name and details: you can click add. Once everyone is entered: click &quot;Do allocations&quot;, download the generated text files, and send them to the recipients named.</p><div id="root"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/christmasgifts/static/js/main.690f1564.js"></script></body></html>
