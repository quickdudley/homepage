		<h1>Jeremy List's homepage</h1>
		<p><a href="cv.html">My CV</a> is available here in HTML format. I am currently (7th of April, 2021) looking for a job.</p>
		<p>This homepage is a bit bare at present, and may very well stay that way, but I have a few ideas I'm working on that might make it more interesting in the future.</p>
